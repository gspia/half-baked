# half-baked
A series of half-baked things hopefully less half-baked later

Some of the following may work as examples or quick starting points, in case you are following somewhat similar path as what produced these. 

At best, it may save some time. If you have ideas, comments, or even PRs, please send them in. 

Especially:
- alternative ways to get the same effect
- code improvements (at the moment the code probably isn't fluent nor easy to read)


TBD: ref, file handling
