# Half-baked samples

A series of half-baked things hopefully less half-baked later. These came out
when I was trying to find solutions to different problems when (learning) working 
with
[Purescript](http://www.purescript.org/), [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)
and [Reflex-platform](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex-platform).
My intention is to occasionally update the sample list while learning.

Some of the following may work as examples or quick starting points, in case
you are following somewhat similar thought path as what produced these.
At best, some of the following half-baked ideas/samples may save your time,
and at worst, exactly the opposite (these are/were made while learning).
If you have ideas, comments, suggestion,
etc., I'd like to hear about those and please, do send them in.


Especially:
- alternative (and or better) ways to get the same effect
- code improvements
- etc.




1. [Purescript Halogen RefLabels and buttons](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb1-button-ref).
   What are RefLabels, how to use them?
   See also [this](https://github.com/epicallan/purescript-halogen-playground).

2. [Purescript Halogen File loading](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb2-fileinputs).
   How to load a file or files to client and do something with them?
   See also [web-audio-demo-player](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-web-audio-player-demo) 
   and associated [blog-post](http://qiita.com/kimagure/items/653c52e77d7cd3567498). It seems to 
   answer some of the questions posed in Main (-> update TBD).

3. [Purescript Halogen client and Haskell Snap server](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb3-filesending).
   How to upload a file or files to server using websockets?

4. [Reflex - buttons and getElementById](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb4-button-reflex).
   This does approximately the same things as sample 1 with Purescript.

5. [Reflex - fileinput](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb5-fileinput-reflex).
   This does approximately the same things as sample 2 with Purescript.

6. [Reflex - file upload](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb6-filesending-reflex).
   This does approximately the same things as sample 3 with Purescript.
   Note that the server is essentially the same in both.

7. [Reflex - bootstrap 4](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb7-bootstrap-reflex).
   Apply boostrap css and build a small ui with fixed top nav and side bar.

8. [Nixos adventure](https://github.com/gspia/half-baked/tree/master/hb8-nixos-adventure).
   To make reflex development fluent and practical, it is good to know 
   a little bit about nix-expressions. To facilitate learning, my spare machine got
   Nixos. This also shows one way to organize nix-files for developing 
   with Reflex.
